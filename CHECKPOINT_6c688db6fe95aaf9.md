  - Automatic gallery refresh every 3 seconds
  - Autosave functionality with conflict prevention
  - Single bucket gallery system with automatic cleanup
  - Core staff table management
- **File Structure**: Complete system with intelligent delayed synchronization
- **Purpose**: Reliable realtime staff table management with user-friendly timing

## üîß **Technical Context**
- **File Type**: Enhanced Applications (index.html + simple-gallery.js)
  - Contains WebSocket realtime synchronization with delayed sync
  - **NEW**: scheduleDelayedSync() function with 3-second delay
  - **NEW**: cancelDelayedSync() function for smart cancellation
  - **NEW**: Enhanced updateUserEditTime() with sync cancellation
  - Includes fallback save system and gallery auto-refresh
  - Features single bucket gallery system
- **Integration**: Complete system with intelligent timing
- **Status**: All functionality working with delayed synchronization

## üìù **Key Features at This Checkpoint**
1. **Staff Table Sync** ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**
   - WebSocket connection with retry logic
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - **NEW**: Delayed synchronization (3 seconds after user stops editing)
   - **NEW**: Smart cancellation when user resumes editing
   - Connection monitoring and recovery

2. **Delayed Synchronization System** ‚úÖ **NEW**
   - scheduleDelayedSync() function with 3-second delay
   - cancelDelayedSync() function for smart cancellation
   - Prevents conflicts during active editing
   - Ensures all devices get updates after user finishes editing

3. **Smart Cancellation** ‚úÖ **NEW**
   - Automatically cancels delayed sync when user resumes editing
   - Prevents unnecessary sync operations during active editing
   - Reschedules sync when user stops editing again
   - Integrated with updateUserEditTime() function

4. **Gallery Sync** ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**
   - Gallery uses separate real-time subscription
   - Updates image_patient_associations table on image upload/delete
   - Automatic refresh every 3 seconds
   - Always active polling for reliability
   - Has intelligent polling as backup

5. **Fallback Save System** ‚úÖ **ACTIVE**
   - Triggers 3 seconds after user stops editing
   - Activates when realtime sync fails
   - Uses existing saveLocalDraft function
   - Stops when realtime sync is restored

6. **Core Functionality** ‚úÖ **PRESERVED**
   - All staff table functionality
   - Autosave system
   - Single bucket gallery system
   - Error handling

## üöÄ **Changes Made**
- ‚úÖ Added scheduleDelayedSync() function with 3-second delay
- ‚úÖ Added cancelDelayedSync() function for smart cancellation
- ‚úÖ Modified handleRealtimeUpdateWithImmediateSync() to use delayed sync
- ‚úÖ Updated saveLocalDraft() to use delayed sync
- ‚úÖ Updated syncToMaster() to use delayed sync
- ‚úÖ Enhanced updateUserEditTime() with sync cancellation
- ‚úÖ Exposed new functions as global functions
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience with intelligent timing

## üìä **Project Health**
- ‚úÖ WebSocket Sync: Active with delayed sync
- ‚úÖ Delayed Sync System: Active (3 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Smart Cancellation: Active
- ‚úÖ Fallback Save System: Active
- ‚úÖ Autosave: Working
- ‚úÖ Single Bucket Gallery: Preserved
- ‚úÖ Core Functionality: Intact
- ‚úÖ Gallery Real-time Sync: Working
- ‚úÖ Gallery Automatic Refresh: Every 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ Code Quality: Clean

## üîÑ **System Status**
- **Staff Table Sync**: Working with delayed synchronization
- **Autosave**: Automatic data saving active
- **Gallery**: Single bucket system with 3-second auto-refresh
- **Error Handling**: Completely silent (console only)
- **Code Base**: Clean and maintainable

## üéØ **Delayed Synchronization Features**
- **3-Second Delay**: Waits 3 seconds after user stops editing
- **Smart Cancellation**: Cancels sync when user resumes editing
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents sync during active editing
- **User-Friendly**: Allows user to finish editing before sync
- **Efficient**: Only syncs when user is truly done editing

## üîß **How It Works**
1. **User Starts Editing**: Any modification triggers updateUserEditTime()
2. **Cancel Pending Sync**: Any pending delayed sync is cancelled
3. **User Stops Editing**: After 3 seconds of inactivity, sync is scheduled
4. **Delayed Sync**: forceImmediateSync() is called after 3 seconds
5. **Data Update**: Fresh data is fetched and UI is updated on all devices
6. **User Resumes**: If user starts editing again, sync is cancelled and rescheduled

## üöÄ **Benefits**
- **User-Friendly**: Allows user to finish editing before sync
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents sync during active editing
- **Efficient**: Only syncs when user is truly done editing
- **Smart**: Automatically cancels and reschedules as needed
- **Reliable**: Ensures all devices get updates after editing is complete

## üì± **User Experience**
- **Smooth Editing**: No interruptions during active editing
- **Automatic Sync**: Syncs automatically 3 seconds after stopping
- **No Conflicts**: Prevents sync conflicts during editing
- **Real-time**: All devices see changes after user finishes editing
- **Intelligent**: System adapts to user's editing patterns
