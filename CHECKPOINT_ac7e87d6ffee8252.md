   - USER_INACTIVITY_DELAY constant (5000ms)
   - Enhanced user inactivity detection
   - More patient sync timing
   - Extended wait time for user inactivity
   - Prevents sync during any user activity

3. **Intelligent Sync Timing** ✅ **UPDATED**
   - Detects when user is currently editing
   - Waits exactly 5 seconds after user stops editing
   - Clears timeouts when user resumes editing
   - Provides smooth editing experience
   - Prevents any sync during user activity

4. **Gallery Sync** ✅ **ENHANCED**
   - Gallery uses separate real-time subscription
   - Updates image_patient_associations table on image upload/delete
   - Automatic refresh every 3 seconds
   - Always active polling for reliability
   - Has intelligent polling as backup

5. **Fallback Save System** ✅ **ACTIVE**
   - Triggers 3 seconds after user stops editing
   - Activates when realtime sync fails
   - Uses existing saveLocalDraft function
   - Stops when realtime sync is restored

6. **Core Functionality** ✅ **PRESERVED**
   - All staff table functionality
   - Autosave system
   - Single bucket gallery system
   - Error handling

## 🚀 **Changes Made**
- ✅ Updated USER_INACTIVITY_DELAY from 3000ms to 5000ms
- ✅ Updated timestamp sync to wait 5 seconds after user stops editing
- ✅ Updated console log messages to reflect 5-second delay
- ✅ Enhanced user inactivity detection with extended timing
- ✅ More patient sync timing for better user experience
- ✅ Extended wait time for user inactivity

## 📊 **Project Health**
- ✅ WebSocket Sync: Active with 5-second user inactivity detection
- ✅ Delayed Sync System: Active (3 seconds)
- ✅ Smart Cancellation: Active
- ✅ 5-Second User Inactivity Detection: Active
- ✅ Fallback Save System: Active
- ✅ Autosave: Working
- ✅ Single Bucket Gallery: Preserved
- ✅ Core Functionality: Intact
- ✅ Gallery Real-time Sync: Working
- ✅ Gallery Automatic Refresh: Every 3 seconds
- ✅ Debugging Tools: Active
- ✅ Code Quality: Clean

## 🔄 **System Status**
- **Staff Table Sync**: Working with 5-second user inactivity detection
- **Autosave**: Automatic data saving active
- **Gallery**: Single bucket system with 3-second auto-refresh
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced with 5-second user inactivity timing
- **Code Base**: Clean and maintainable
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive tools available

## 🎯 **5-Second User Inactivity Features**
- **Activity Detection**: Detects when user is currently editing
- **Extended Timing**: Waits exactly 5 seconds after user stops editing
- **Timeout Management**: Clears timeouts when user resumes editing
- **No Interruptions**: Prevents any sync during user activity
- **Smooth Experience**: Provides seamless editing experience

## 🔧 **How It Works**
1. **User Activity Check**: System checks if user is currently editing
2. **5-Second Threshold**: If user edited within 5 seconds, skip sync
3. **Timeout Management**: Clear any existing timeouts when user resumes
4. **Change Detection**: Only check for changes after 5+ seconds of inactivity
5. **Sync Execution**: Sync only when user has been inactive for 5+ seconds

## 🚀 **Benefits**
- **Extended Timing**: Waits 5 seconds after user stops editing
- **No Interruptions**: Prevents any sync during user activity
- **Smooth Experience**: Provides seamless editing experience
- **Reliable**: Ensures data synchronization without conflicts
- **User-Friendly**: Respects user's editing patterns with extended timing

## 📱 **User Experience**
- **Smooth Editing**: No interruptions while typing
- **Extended Timing**: Waits 5 seconds after user stops
- **No Conflicts**: Prevents sync conflicts during input
- **Transparent**: Works behind the scenes
- **Professional**: Suitable for professional environments

## 🔧 **How to Use**
1. **Automatic**: System automatically detects user activity
2. **Manual Start**: `window.startTimestampSync()` to force start
3. **Manual Stop**: `window.stopTimestampSync()` to force stop
4. **Status Check**: `window.debugRealtimeSync()` to check status
5. **Reset**: `window.resetRealtimeSync()` to reset everything

## 🎯 **Sync Process**
- **Every 1 second**: System checks for user activity
- **User Active**: Skip sync and clear timeouts
- **User Inactive**: Wait for 5+ seconds of inactivity
- **Change Detection**: Check for changes only after inactivity
- **Sync Execution**: Sync only when user has been inactive

## 🔧 **Technical Details**
- **TIMESTAMP_SYNC_INTERVAL**: 1000ms (check every 1 second)
- **USER_INACTIVITY_DELAY**: 5000ms (wait 5 seconds after user stops)
- **userInactivityTimeout**: Manages inactivity timeouts
- **checkUserActivityAndScheduleSync()**: Main activity detection function
- **checkForDataChanges()**: Data change detection function

## 📊 **Timing Comparison**
- **Previous**: 3 seconds after user stops editing
- **Current**: 5 seconds after user stops editing
- **Benefit**: More patient sync timing for better user experience
- **Result**: Less frequent sync interruptions
